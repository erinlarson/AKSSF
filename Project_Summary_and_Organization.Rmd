# AKSSF

## AKSSF project workflow

Project to describe and map thermal sensitivities for Southern Alaska - Cook Inlet, Prince William Sound, and Copper River, Kodiak, and Bristol Bay.

Note: supplemental funding from FWS to include Kodiak temperature data in this project. And, second AKSSF award to do a similar analysis for Bristol Bay. Kodiak data will be cleaned in this repo. Bristol Bay data are being prepared concurrently for another project so final data can be imported from [SWSHP-Bristol-Bay-Thermal-Diversity github repo](https://github.com/rsshaftel/SWSHP-Bristol-Bay-Thermal-Diversity).


1. Data Availability

All metadata and data ready:

* Deshka temperature model output - CIK and FWS data from 2017-2019
* Kenai temperature model output - Ben Meyers, CIK and KWF
* Anchor temperature model output - CIK, APU, and KBRR
* CIK data on KNB - this will include all 48 sites in network, but only through 2017.
* NPS data on KNB from Trey Simmons
* ADFG data on KNB for Kodiak Island, three streams with one summer of data

QA not complete:
* USFS data for streams in Chugach National Forest from Luca Adelfio. Dustin and I chatted with him and his data probably need a little review. He also sent over some more recent data from 4 Kenai sites that should be reviewed.

Metadata ready, but not data (i.e. I need to read in and format data):

* FWS data for Kodiak Refuge, OSM sites on Kodiak (2) and Copper River (2), and WRB sites on Kodiak (2) -- from Meg Perdue, received Oct 2020. Check to see if FWS data archived on KNB is needed to supplement what Meg sent over -- those data are all through 2017.
* USGS sites selected in GIS from akoats working. Get data from dataRetrieval library in R
* ACCS temperature data from Little Susitna watershed - summer 2016 and 2019-2020. Dustin is doing data prep in a separate [Little_Susitna github repo](https://github.com/rsshaftel/Little_Susitna). Grabbed 2016 sites from akoats metadata and combined with 2019 sites from logger database, some might be the same, will need to check in GIS.
* post-2017 data from Sue has been sent over. 


Outstanding data requests:

* additional PWS data from Luca. He is sending data from 3-4 sites from a graduate student project that has not been QAed and also more years of data for their PWS sites.
* Native Village of Eyak data for Cordova. Talked with James Paley and they have data from two creeks in Cordova from level loggers so buried just subsurface. Not the best data so probably not worth waiting on.
* KRAA data for Little Waterfall, Pillar Creeks, and Telrod Creeks - contact is Trenten Dodson, but talked with Nate Webber, he will send over the data, 2015-2019. He found Telrod on AKOATs, but not showing on our mapper, check working version of akoats to see if it is there. 
* ADFG data - contact is Heather Finkle. Data through 2017 archived on KNB have already been included. I will email her to see if more years are available.
* Larsen Bay Tribe, site on Karluk - called Alexander Panamaroff, but he wanted me to talk with Jamie Hubbard, who manages the data.  
* Alutiiq Tribe, site on Big Creek - data request to Lepani Nadore, data will come from Jeff Davis and should be ready end February.

Low priority datasets (wait to see if we decide to only look at sensitivity for sites with a minimum number of years of data before we pursue additional datasets):

* Mat-Su thermal regimes project - daily data were saved as a final product. This would include CIK data already archived on KNB, USGS data that I can grab separately, and ARRI data from Mat-Su. I could just re-import the raw ARRI data, I believe they cleaned it for me.
* AEA data for Susitna-Watana dam. I looked at this data for the thermal regimes project and it wasn't clean. They had temperature arrays on the Susitna River with some pretty anomalous readings between loggers. We could decide to clean this dataset for this project, but it would probably be a week of someone's time. 
* Little Su tributaries as part of a Masters project. I have this data and only used the most downstream locations for the thermal regimes project, I could grab those along with the ARRI data and import.


Bristol Bay:

All Bristol Bay data are being cleaned in a separate [github repo](https://github.com/rsshaftel/SWSHP-Bristol-Bay-Thermal-Diversity).
(Note that the only data we are missing in Bristol Bay are Dan Young's sites, otherwise everything should be good. Also need to QA UW data - talk to Dan and Jackie.)


2. Data cleaning

All data need to be formatted consistently so that we can combine them for the data analysis step. All datasets should be saved as separate data files and sites files for import to AKTEMP later. 

Data file

* SiteID
* sampleDate
* sampleTime
* Temeperature
* useData

Sites file

* SiteID
* AKOATS_ID
* latitude
* longitude
* Source_Name
* Contact_Name

3. Air temperature extraction

The sites file will be used in ArcGIS to extract catchments for each site. In R, we can calculate an average air temperature across the catchment or a site buffer from DAYMET data for the appropriate months and years of data. We aren't predicting with air temperatures so it only needs to match the empirical data. There is code in the temperature modeling repos (KFHP) to get this started.

4. Thermal sensitivity analysis

Per Daniel, Tim Cline has the correct code for running the DFA. He did a slightly different procedure than what Peter Lisi did in the original paper for Bristol Bay. See Cline's snow paper and DFA.

## Repository Organization

Folders in this repo:

* data_preparation folder: this include scripts for reading in and wrangling data. data_[provider name] are the scripts for reading and formatting metadata and data files, saved as .rds. data_QA_[provider name] are scripts for datasets that required QA. QAed data have a useData flag that indicates data to be removed prior to analysis.
* docs folder
