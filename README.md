AKSSF project description

Project to describe and map thermal sensitivities for Central and Southwest Alaska - Cook Inlet, Prince William Sound, and Copper River, Kodiak, and Bristol Bay.

Note: supplemental funding from FWS to include Kodiak temperature data in this project. And, second AKSSF award to do a similar analysis for Bristol Bay. Kodiak data will be cleaned in this repo. Bristol Bay data are being prepared concurrently for another project so final data can be imported from [SWSHP-Bristol-Bay-Thermal-Diversity github repo](https://github.com/rsshaftel/SWSHP-Bristol-Bay-Thermal-Diversity).


Project Objectives

Objective 1: Characterize thermal regimes as they relate to salmon life-histories - specifically juvenile rearing, spawning, and adult migration.
Objective 2: Estimate thermal sensitivity of salmon habitats to climate change.
Objective 3: Map thermal sensitivities of salmon habitats and identify habitats more at risk to climate warming, habitats with high potential to provide cold-water refugia under future climate change, and an assessment of the exposure of subsistence fisheries (i.e., populations) to temperature warming.
Objective 4: Make project analysis and geospatial databases and maps from Objectives 1-3 publicly available to stakeholders through University of Alaskaâ€™s Center for Conservation Science (ACCS) data portal, state meetings, conferences, and publications.
