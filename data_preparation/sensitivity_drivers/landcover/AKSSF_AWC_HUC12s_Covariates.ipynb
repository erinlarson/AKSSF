    "# Watershed metrics for all Huc12 subwatersheds that intersect AWC recorded streams\n",
    "Iterate over AKSSF regions and identify all HUC12 sub-watersheds that intersect an AWC recorded stream. Identify the downstream-most/outlet catchment for each Huc12 from this pool and convert the polygon to INSIDE centroid point.  Calculate the distance to coastline as the straight line distance in Km from centroid point to NHD recorded coastline and export this as a feature class/table.  Next use the outlet catchments unique identifier to query the appropriate dataset and build watersheds for each outlet catchment.  Calculate watershed metrics listed in the covariate section and export final merged csv using the catchment unique identifier field \"cat_ID_con\" to link the metric back to the source catchment/HUC12.
